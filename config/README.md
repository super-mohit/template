# Configuration Directory

This directory contains configuration files for deployment and operations.

## Files

### `k8s-env-config.txt`
Environment variables configuration for Kubernetes deployments.

This file defines which environment variables should be included in the Kubernetes deployment manifests generated by the Azure Pipeline.

**Format:**
```ini
[FRONTEND]
VARIABLE_NAME_1
VARIABLE_NAME_2

[BACKEND]
VARIABLE_NAME_3
VARIABLE_NAME_4
```

**Usage:**
- Only variable **names** are stored here, not values
- Actual values come from Azure Pipeline Variables or K8s Secrets
- The pipeline automatically reads this file during deployment

**Documentation:**
See [KUBERNETES-ENV-CONFIG.md](../docs/KUBERNETES-ENV-CONFIG.md) for complete documentation.

## Adding Configuration Files

Place deployment-related configuration files in this directory:
- Environment variable lists
- Feature flags
- Deployment settings
- Resource configurations

Keep sensitive values (passwords, API keys) out of this directory - use proper secret management instead.
